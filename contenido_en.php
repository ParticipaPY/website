$presentacion = "The question we ask ourselves here is: <b>how technology can be used to build sustainable, affordable, and accessible spaces of civic participation?</b> Spaces that, tailored to Paraguay's socio-economic and cultural context, allow citizens to gather together to discuss solutions, proposals and ideas to address public interest issues (e.g., public transportation, sanitary system).<br><br>

	Participa is a 2-year-long research project funded by the CONACYT (National Council of Science and Technology of Paraguay) and conducted by a multidisciplinary team of Informatics and Sociology professors, researchers and technicians from the Catholic University of Asuncion, Paraguay (UCA) and the University of Trento, Italia (UniTN).<br><br>

	In Participa, first, we plan to explore similar initiatives that have been already proposed in other countries. Later, we are going to research, through pilot studies, the motives, characteristics, and forms of the ICT-mediated civic participation in Paraguay. Finally, our work is going to be focused on modeling, designing, developing and implementing of technology solutions and processes that enable Paraguayan citizens to participate in the ideation of solutions for common interest issues.";
